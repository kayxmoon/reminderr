        <h2>please do self love</h2>
        <p>You have to choose yourself, even when others refuse to. Self love is choosing
            yourself and choosing yourself is self care. You're entertaining the wrong
            things with the wrong people because you're struggling with loving yourself.
            It's okay to take a break, a moment for yourself.

        <h2>if you're feeling sad</h2>
        <p>Let it out. Go ahead. You don't deserve what's happening to you, but that doesn't mean you should stop
            being nice. You can find
            joy in spreading it to others, and while some may find it fun to bring you down, it's slowly destroying
            their soul. Talk to god, only he knows what you're going through, no one else can really help you except for
            him.
